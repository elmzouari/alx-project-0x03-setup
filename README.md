# alx-project-0x03-setup

This project is part of the ALX TypeScript curriculum. The goal is to implement a shared layout system in a Next.js application using the DRY principle.

## Objective

In most applications, multiple pages share the same layout (such as a header and footer). Instead of repeating these components on every page, this project uses a shared `Layout` component to wrap pages consistently.

## Project Setup

The project was bootstrapped using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest alx-project-0x03 --ts --eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
